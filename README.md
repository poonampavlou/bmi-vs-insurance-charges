# bmi-vs-insurance-charges
For this project, I gathered data regarding insurance charges with features such as BMI, smoker, gender, location etc. 
After analysing the data, I decided to use a scatter graph to represent the most important features of the data. 
Due to the large number of data points I decided to split the table by up gender and plotted BMI and insurance charges against each other. 
In addition, each of these graphs confirmed if the individual was a smoker or non-smoker to see how this would affect their insurance charges. 
I used np.polyfit to add two lines of best fit on each graph; one for BMI vs insurance charges for female smokers and non-smokers. I repeated the process for the male data. 
In addition, to allow for easy comparison I created subplots for the graphs to be viewed side by side.
